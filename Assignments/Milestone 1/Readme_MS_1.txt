1) Location photos are located in the resources folder in a sub folder titled 'Location Photos'.  I used images I had taken on campus last fall, I took hundreds of photos of UVU to use as reference for a personal project, I plan on making a map of UVU with Source SDk, so I didn't feel the need to retake the same photos because my final project scene will be on campus.

2) Will replace reference photos within the Maya files with my own pictures instead of photos found on Google.

3) Both placeholder models are super basic right now, they will be greatly improved over the next iterations, I realize they are terrible, I focused on the 'Hero Model' of the Biplane primarily.
